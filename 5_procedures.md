# Procedures

This chapter

* Introduces procedures as a way to avoid having to type things all the time ('how do we make our program greet us?')
* Introduces the idea of a code file as 'stored procedures'
* Introduces the difference between defining a procedure and calling it (by defining a `greet` function in a file required by `irb` with `irb -r greet.rb` and then immediately invoking it, first in the REPL then in the file)
* Introduces the idea of MVP steps
* Introduces the idea of 'global scope' by how the procedure is defined on the Universe (main function) itself
