# Classes

This chapter

* Queries what the hell this `Time` thing is and why it has an uppercase
* Points out that some things, like `Time`, should really only exist once (there's only one 'Time')
* Points out that there are many different _instances_ of 'Time' (1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, and so on)
* Uses `new` with `Time` to capture _instances of `Time`_
* Uses _Plato's Theory of Forms_ to generalise what classes are, and how they relate to instances.
