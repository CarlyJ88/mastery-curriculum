# Mastery Curriculum

Welcome to the Ruby mastery curriculum! Your aim will be to become confident writing real-world procedural programs in Ruby.

* Real-world? Programs that are useful in the real world. For example, a program to manage your todo list.

* Procedural? Programs that do something by working through a series of steps. Somewhat like cooking recipes.

## Approach

1. Work through a chapter (see below).

2. When you've absorbed the content of the chapter thoroughly, complete the quiz for the chapter.  You can do that at the [quiz repository](https://github.com/makersacademy/mastery-quizzes).

3. Once you have submitted your quiz answers, and your answers have been verified as correct, continue to the next chapter.

Your aim is to get through all the chapters, but the most important thing for your learning is to only move on from a chapter once you've completed the quiz.
