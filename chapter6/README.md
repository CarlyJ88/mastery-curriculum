# Arrays

This chapter

* Shows shortcomings of setting a new variable each time we make a todo
* Gives arrays as a place to store variables
* Plays around with accessing and retrieving things from an array, making it clear that there's a lot of pointing going on and we can think of these sorts of pointers as being 'inside' the object (even though they're not)
